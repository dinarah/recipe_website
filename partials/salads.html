            <h4 class="recipeName">Liver Salad</h4>
            <img class="recipeImage" src="images/thumb_salad1.jpg">
            <p class="recipeText">My family likes salads with meat, but this time we cook something special. I offer you to try liver salad with layers. It can become your lunch or decorate your celebration serving. For this salad we use:
                <ul>
                    <li>350gr. chicken or beef liver</li>
                    <li>4 potatos</li>
                    <li>1 red paprika </li>
                    <li>2 carrots </li>
                    <li>cornishons or pickles</li>
                    <li>2 eggs</li>
                    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>vegetable oil to fry</li>
                    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                    <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
                </ul>
                For this salad we need to make french fries. Peel off potatos, rinse and cut in to thin sticks, add salt and fry in a hot pan with preheated oil. To save time we boil 2 eggs for 10 minutes while our french fries are being cooked. When potato sticks become soft and brown take them out to the plate where you want to surve your salad. Next we rinse liver and cut in small cubes or strings. In the pan with 2 tablespoons of oil we fry the liver. At the same time we cut in slices red paprika. When the liver has brown cover and there is no juice it's cooked. To finish we sprinkle salt and black pepper on it. We put our liver on top of french fries and continue with paprika. We need to fry it too. When you see that slices of paprika became soft take it out to the plate with liver. We already have three layers in our plate. We move now to carrots. Peel them and grate, mix with 1 tablespoon of mayonaisse and with squashed clove of garlic. Add salt, pepper and place as a next layer. Cut pickles in to sticks and make a new layer from them. Boiled eggs will be the last. Slice them and mix with ! tablespoon of mayounaise. Place the mixture on top of the salad and decorate like you wish. Call your family to finish this salad till it's warm!

            <h4 class="recipeName2">Chicken Salad</h4>
            <img class="recipeImage" src="images/thumb_salad2.jpg">
            <p class="recipeText">
                <ul>
                    <li>1 chicken breast(approximately 300gr.)</li>
                    <li>3 potatos</li>
                    <li>3 carrots</li>
                    <li>2 eggs </li>
                    <li>200 gr. mazarella or other grated chees you like</li>
                    <li> 2 beets</li>
                    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>Salt and spices for chicken</li>
                </ul>
                This salad contains boiled vegetables and eggs so let's start with them. Washed beets we cook in a boiled water for 40 minutes. During this time we riinse and peel of potatos with carrots and eggs, place in a big pot with water so it will cover all of them. When the water boils we wait 10 minutes and take out patatos with eggs and let them cool up in cold water. Let carrots to be cooked 10 minutes more. While our vegatables are boilng we are busy with our chicken breast. I like when chicken breast is fried, but to make it helthier you can boil it for 20 minutes. To fry chicken you need to rinse it and dry with towels. Cut in small sticks and fry in preheatred vegetable oil with salt and spices for chicken untill it's golden brown. Now we have everything to make our salad. In a flat plate we grate potatos, chicken, carrot, beet, eggs. Every layer we grease with mayonnaise and cover our salad with mazarella. What can be better for the lunch?
